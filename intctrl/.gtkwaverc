# This allows another character in addition to the hier_delimeter to be used to delimit levels in the hierarchy for VCD. Only the first character in the value is significant. Note that this is normally off. The intended use is to resolve the hierarchies of netlist based models that often contain slashes to delimit hierarchy inside of $var statements. 
#alt_hier_delimeter

# Allows the specification of a prefix hierarchy for VCD files. This can be done in "pieces," so that multiple layers of hierarchy are prepended to symbol names with the most significant addition occurring first (see .gtkwaverc in the examples/vcd directory). The intended use of this is to have the ability to add "project" prefixes which allow easier selection of everything from the tree hierarchy. 
#append_vcd_hier

# Speeds up vcd loading and takes up less memory. The downside is that atomic vectors are treated internally as a single bit and can't be coalesced into larger vectors or split up. Because of this single bit nature, the bundle down and bundle up operations when used in Signal Search Regexp , Signal Search Hierarchy, and Signal Search Tree will perfom seemingly unpredictably. 
# Note that savefiles are largely incompatible between atomic and non-atomic modes (i.e., signal information is stored differently). This variable normally defaults to "on" and it is suggested that it remain there unless vector splitting is a necessity. 
atomic_vectors yes

# A nonzero value enables autocoalescing of VCD vectors when applicable. This may be toggled dynamically during wave viewer usage.

# indicates that the VCD recoder should spill all generated vlists to a tempfile on disk in order to reduce memory usage. Default is off.
